# Reporting Issues

If you encounter a bug or unexpected behavior while using PyPNM, please report it
so we can investigate and resolve the issue. This document outlines the steps to
create a support bundle that captures the necessary data for debugging.

## Support Bundle Script

PyPNM includes a support bundle script that collects relevant logs, database
entries, and configuration files related to your issue. This script helps
sanitize sensitive information before sharing it with the PyPNM support team.

## FAQ

Q: Why is extension data missing after processing a PNM transaction record?  
A: Ensure the transaction record includes an `extension` mapping and that the update helper merges the extension into the PNM data before returning the result.

## TODO

- Add or update a FAQ entry whenever an error is fixed so the resolution is documented.
