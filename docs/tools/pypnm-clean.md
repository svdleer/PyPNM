# PyPNM Cleanup Script

The PyPNM Cleanup Script is a shell utility located in the `tools/` directory. It provides a structured way to clean up logs, Python cache files, build artifacts, generated output, and internal `.data` folders related to PNM processing.

> Use this tool to reset analysis directories and keep the repository free of stale or generated files.

## Features

* Clean specific categories of build and runtime artifacts or perform a full cleanup.
* Support for scoped operations (for example, Python caches only, or PNM data only).
* Can be run from any root directory (defaults to the current directory).
* Uses simple, repeatable patterns so it can be safely integrated into CI or local workflows.

## Directories and Options

The table below summarizes which directories are affected by each option. All paths are resolved relative to the chosen `ROOT_DIR`.

| Option        | Description                                      | Directories removed (if present)                                       |

| `--plot-data` | Clean plotting data and archive artifacts.       | `.data/png/`, `.data/csv/`, `.data/archive/`                          |
| `--msg-rsp`   | Clean message-response artifacts.                | `.data/msg_rsp/`                                                      |
| `--output`    | Clean high-level output files.                   | `output/`                                                             |
| `--issues`    | Clean support bundles (preserves `issues/` directory). | `issues/` contents                                                    |
| `--remove-issues` | Remove the entire `issues/` directory.        | `issues/`                                                             |

| `--all`       | Run every cleanup operation listed above.        | All of the above                                                      |

## Usage

```bash
./tools/maintenance/clean.sh [OPTIONS] [ROOT_DIR]
```

* `OPTIONS`: One or more of the flags listed in the table above. Combine them to target multiple areas (for example, `--python --build`).

* `ROOT_DIR`: Optional path that serves as the root of the cleanup operation.  
  If omitted, the script uses the current working directory.

### Examples

Clean everything under the current directory:

```bash
./tools/maintenance/clean.sh --all
```

Clean only Python caches and build artifacts:

```bash
./tools/maintenance/clean.sh --python --build
```

Clean PNM data and plot-related data from a specific project root:

```bash
./tools/maintenance/clean.sh --pnm --plot-data ~/Projects/PyPNM
```

Clean message-response artifacts only:

```bash
./tools/maintenance/clean.sh --msg-rsp
```

## Notes

* The script uses `set -euo pipefail` to fail fast on errors or undefined variables.
* Deletion is performed via a small helper that checks for path existence before removal.
* All directories are interpreted relative to `ROOT_DIR`, which allows you to point the script at different clones or sandboxes.
