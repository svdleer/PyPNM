    Compute common time-domain statistics for 1D signals,

    Available statistics:
      - mean: Arithmetic average of the signal values.
      - median: Middle value when the data is sorted, robust to outliers.
      - std: Population standard deviation, measures data dispersion around the mean.
      - variance: Population variance, square of the standard deviation.
      - power: Mean squared value of the signal (average power).
      - peak_to_peak: Difference between maximum and minimum values (signal range).
      - mean_abs_deviation: Mean of absolute deviations from the mean, another measure of dispersion.
      - skewness: Third standardized moment, indicates signal asymmetry.
      - kurtosis: Fourth standardized moment, indicates heaviness of tails versus a Gaussian.
      - crest_factor: Ratio of peak amplitude to the square root of power, shows peak prominence.
      - zero_crossing_rate: Fraction of successive sample sign changes, indicates signal frequency content.
      - zero_crossings: Total count of sign changes in the signal.
