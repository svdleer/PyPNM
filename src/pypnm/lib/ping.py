class Ping:
    """
    A simple cross-platform Ping utility to check if a device is reachable.

    This helper resolves hostnames to concrete IPv4/IPv6 addresses where
    possible and attempts to ping each resolved address until one succeeds.
    If DNS resolution fails, it falls back to invoking ping with the original
    host string.

    This avoids hard-coding special cases such as "localhost" while still
    reflecting real network misconfigurations (for example, loopback or
    address-family issues).

        Checks if the given host is reachable via ICMP ping.

        Parameters:
        - host (str): The IP address or hostname to ping.

        - count (int): Number of ping attempts (default: 1)
