class PnmFileTransaction:
    """
    Manages persistent tracking of PNM file transactions across the PyPNM system.

    Each transaction corresponds to a PNM test result file (e.g., RxMER, Spectrum Analysis),
    whether generated through automated measurements or manually uploaded by a user.

    A transaction includes:
        - A unique transaction ID (16-char SHA-256 digest)
        - Timestamp (epoch time)
        - MAC address of the cable modem
        - PNM test type (e.g., DS_RXMER, SPECTRUM_ANALYZER)
        - Filename of the associated binary data file

    Transactions are stored in a central JSON file defined in system config at:
    `PnmFileRetrieval.transaction_db`.

    Usage Scenarios:
        - When a measurement test completes and produces a file.
        - When a user uploads a file manually via the REST API.
        - When retrieving metadata about previously captured test files.

    Attributes:
        transaction_db_path (Path): Path to the JSON file where all transactions are recorded.

    Record:
        {
            "<transaction_id>": {

        Record A Transaction Initiated From An Actual Cable Modem Test.

        This method is invoked by measurement services once a PNM capture has
        successfully completed and produced a result file. It pulls the current
        system description from the cable modem, generates a new transaction
        identifier, and appends a normalized record into the transaction
        database.

        Parameters
        ----------
        cable_modem:
            Live `CableModem` instance representing the device under test. Used
            to obtain the MAC address and system description snapshot.
        pnm_test_type:
            Enumeration value describing which PNM test produced the file
            (for example, DS_RXMER, DS_OFDM_HISTOGRAM, DS_CONSTELLATION).
        filename:
            Relative or absolute path to the generated PNM binary file, as
            stored by the calling measurement service.

        -------
        str
